- **Hours:** 17 different hours (6 AM - 10 PM)
- **Days of Week:** All 7 days
- **Avg observations per group:** 10.0

### Sample Results:
```
Route      Hour  DOW  P80   P90   P95   Obs
BRI→PAD    8     Mon  4.2   7.7   10.9  8
BRI→PAD    8     Tue  5.8   7.8   9.4   9
BRI→PAD    8     Wed  9.2   15.2  20.6  10
```

**Quality:** ✅ Excellent - proper percentile distribution

## ✅ Step 2: QA Report Generated

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

### Report Location:
- Check `reports/` folder for latest `qa_*.html` file
- Open in browser to view comprehensive data quality analysis

### What was validated:
- ✅ Percentile monotonicity (p80 ≤ p90 ≤ p95)
- ✅ Coverage matrix by route/hour/day
- ✅ Data quality checks
- ✅ Error analysis from collection logs

## ✅ Step 3: Dashboard Launched

**Status:** ✅ RUNNING

### Access:
The Streamlit dashboard should be running at:
- **URL:** http://localhost:8501

If it's not open automatically, open your web browser and navigate to the URL above.

### Dashboard Features:
- 📊 **Interactive heatmaps** by route and time
- 📈 **Delay patterns** by hour and day of week  
- 🔍 **Route comparisons** across different times
- 📉 **Percentile visualizations** (p80, p90, p95)
- 💾 **Data export** capabilities

### Available Routes:
1. **BRI → PAD** (Bristol to Paddington)
2. **CDF → PAD** (Cardiff to Paddington)
3. **EXD → PAD** (Exeter to Paddington)
4. **PAD → HXX** (Paddington to Heathrow)
5. **VIC → GTW** (Victoria to Gatwick)

## 🎯 What You Can Do Now

### 1. Explore the Dashboard
- Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser
- Filter by route, hour, or day of week
- Compare different percentile levels
- Export data for further analysis

### 2. Review QA Report
```bash
# Open latest QA report in browser
start reports\qa_*.html
```

### 3. Export Percentiles for Use
The percentiles are saved in `data/leg_percentiles.csv` and ready to use in:
- Your own analysis scripts
- External tools (Excel, R, etc.)
- API integrations
- Mobile apps

### 4. Continue Data Collection
If you want more data for better statistical power:
```bash
# Collect August data
# Update config/month_run.yaml to date_start: "2025-08-01", date_end: "2025-08-31"
python orchestrate_month.py --config config/month_run.yaml
```
