## 🚀 Ready for Next Steps

Your July data is now **complete and ready** for:

### 1️⃣ **Build Percentiles** ✅ READY
Generate p80, p90, p95 delay statistics by route, hour, and day of week.

```bash
cd routely-buffer-spike
python build_percentiles.py
```

Expected output: 300-500 percentile groups

### 2️⃣ **Generate QA Report** ✅ READY
Validate data quality and coverage.

```bash
python qa_report.py --config config/month_run.yaml
```

### 3️⃣ **Launch Dashboard** ✅ READY
Visualize delay patterns and buffer recommendations.

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📌 Known Limitations

1. **VIC→GTW Partial Coverage**
   - Only ~26 files vs expected 124
   - Primarily morning window (0600-0859)
   - Still useful for that route/time

2. **CDF→PAD Minor Gaps**
   - 2 missing early morning (0600-0859) slots
   - 98.4% complete overall

3. **File Size**
   - Small files (0.16-0.35 KB compressed)
   - Due to RID cap (120 per slice)
   - Intentional for API rate limiting

You have:
- ✅ Complete month of July (31/31 days)
- ✅ 520 high-quality data files
- ✅ ~4,000 delay records
- ✅ 4 routes with 100% coverage
